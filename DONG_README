* To enable the debug mode, add dbg as an option for make.
* To enable NVM support, add NVM_EXT=Y as an option for make.
* To intercept specific heap memory allocation, add MALLOC_INTERCEPT=Y as an option for make

For example, the following enables the debug mode as well NVM spport and intercepting 
specific heap memory allocation.
make INCS=-I/home/scale/pin/extras/xed2-intel64/include \
	  NVM_EXT=Y dbg MALLOC_INTERCEPT=Y -j 8

* You can configure the heap memory size when you intercept heap memory allocation by doing 
the following.
  export HEAP_MEM_SIZE=1024 
"1024" refers to 1024 bytes.

* There is an example to show how to intercept heap memory allocation.
You can find the example in McSimA-_NVM/Apps/mem_alloc
To run the example code with the simulator, try the following

cd McSimA-_NVM/McSim
./mcsim -mdfile ../Apps/dong-pcm.py -runfile ../Apps/list/run-mem_alloc.py
